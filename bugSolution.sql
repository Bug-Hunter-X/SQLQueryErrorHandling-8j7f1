To correct this issue, review your SQL query and ensure all functions and data types are compatible with the target database system. In the case of using MySQL's `YEAR()` function in a PostgreSQL database, replace it with PostgreSQL's `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM column_name)`. If you're experiencing issues with data type mismatches, review your table schemas and casting operations to ensure everything aligns correctly. For example, if your query is expecting an integer but receiving a string, use explicit casting functions like `CAST(column_name AS INTEGER)` to resolve the discrepancy. This improved approach ensures compatibility and avoids unexpected errors.
