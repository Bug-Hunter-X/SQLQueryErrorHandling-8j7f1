The SQL query uses a function that is not available in the database system, such as using a function that is only available in MySQL within a PostgreSQL database.  This often leads to unexpected errors or exceptions during query execution. For example, using the MySQL function `YEAR()` within a PostgreSQL environment would fail.  Another example is using string functions expecting a different data type.
